chapelco-weather-goajs
======================

Repository for a weather website I created for Chapelco Ski Resort in Argentina. The website is written in a combination of Golang and AngularJS and was is my first project in both. You can find my first version of the website in Ruby/Sinatra/jQuery at EntilZha/chapelco-weather-ruby
